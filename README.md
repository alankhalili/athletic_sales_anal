# athletic_sales_anal


**Introduction**

We've analyzed sales data to gain insights into:
    - which cities in the U.S. have sold the most athletic wear over two years;
    - which retailers had the greatest total sales for athletic wear,
    - which retailers sold the most women's athletic footwear and;
    - which day and week had the highest sales for women's athletic footwear.

**Configuration**

The data from two files (2020 and 2021) were combined for the initial data analysis (row ontop of row).
Afterwards, the data was further segmented into categories and sub categories to find the 
largest number of units sold and sales reveneus by women's athletic shoes, retailer, region, state, and city.  

**Findings**
1.  Women's athletic shoes
    - Most of the unit sales were:
        - Leading up to December holidays
        - Accross the summer months when weather was more condusive to outdoor activities.
    - The unit sales were significantly higher in  2021 than 2020 (by a factor of ~4.5x)
    - The regional leading retailers were primarily located in the West and NorthEast regions
2.  Accross all segments:
    - Total unit sales were fairly balanced between the second tier large cities.
        - Actual Sales performance by city varied significantly for LA.   All other top cities reveneus mirrored unit sales in rankings.
